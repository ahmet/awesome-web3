# Security Policy

## Supported Project Scope

**awesome-web3** is a curated “awesome list” and a static website hosted at [awesome-web3.com](https://awesome-web3.com).

There is **no executable backend code, smart contracts, or hosted APIs** in this repository.

Security reports are relevant only to:
- The repository content itself (Markdown, configuration, build scripts)
- The static website build and deployment pipeline
- Potential supply-chain risks introduced via dependencies or build tooling
- Malicious links, phishing, or compromised third-party resources listed in the project

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, **please report it responsibly**.

### Preferred Method (Private)
- Use **GitHub Security Advisories**  
  https://github.com/ahmet/awesome-web3/security/advisories/new

This allows private discussion and coordinated remediation.

### Alternative
If GitHub Security Advisories are not suitable, you may:
- Open a **private issue** with minimal details and request maintainers to move the discussion off-platform

> Please **do not publicly disclose** security issues before maintainers have had a chance to review and address them.

## What to Report

Please report issues such as:
- Malicious or compromised links included in the list
- Phishing, scam, or impersonation resources
- Dependency or build-time vulnerabilities
- Injection of malicious scripts into website assets
- Unauthorized changes affecting site integrity or user trust

## What Is Out of Scope

The following are **not** considered vulnerabilities:
- Issues in third-party projects merely linked from the list
- General criticism of listed tools or protocols
- Theoretical blockchain or smart-contract vulnerabilities unrelated to this repository
- Requests for removal based on preference or competition

## Disclosure Process

1. Maintainers acknowledge the report.
2. The issue is assessed for validity and impact.
3. Malicious or vulnerable content is removed or corrected.
4. If applicable, a public note or advisory is published.

Response times may vary, but reports are reviewed in good faith.

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure and efforts to keep the Web3 ecosystem safer.  
Security researchers will be credited where appropriate, unless anonymity is requested.
